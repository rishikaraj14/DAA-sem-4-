# DAA Semester 4 – Algorithms Lab Programs

This repository contains implementations of core algorithms studied in **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** for **Semester 4**.  
The programs are written in **C and C++** and are intended for **lab work, assignments, and viva preparation**.

## 📁 Contents of the Repository

### 1️⃣ Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Heap-based Sorting**
- **AVL Tree–based Sorting**

These programs demonstrate:
- Sorting of large datasets
- Comparison of basic and advanced sorting techniques
- Measurement of CPU execution time using `clock()`

---

### 2️⃣ String Matching
- **Brute Force String Matching Algorithm**

This program:
- Accepts a main string and a pattern string
- Searches for all occurrences of the pattern in the text
- Displays starting indices where the pattern is found
